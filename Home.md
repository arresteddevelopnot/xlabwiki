The **scope + objective** of this is to address:

On my first week, what do I need to know to be at the right place at the right time?

What this is
------------

-   an informal (but **structured +** **accurate**) **snapshot** of **our workflows**
-   the **team's meta-knowledge** in one place

What this is not
----------------

-   a **knowledge-base for everything** we've done
-   information on anything beyond **core team admin**

(in the spirit of documenting everything):

**We're not great at distributed working** (we're better than many **around us**, but **that's not a representative sample)**. That's **not a knock** against us - we've **had no reason** to be

**Documentation** is a **universal 'best practice'** for **distributed, asynchronous teams,** according to those that have been '**doing distributed**' for **longer + on a bigger scale** - **GitLab, Basecamp, Automattic,** etc; Â this is an **experiment** to see if we agree

Similar rationale for the other stuff I was 'pushing' ðŸ˜¬

**e.g.** **[ðŸ‘‰ Tandem](https://coda.io/d/handbook_d8YyqXR1Myf/toolkit-list_sua97)****,** **[ðŸ‘‰ JIRA sucks / better programme management](https://coda.io/d/handbook_d8YyqXR1Myf/OKRs_surEt)****,** **[ðŸ‘‰ a changelog](https://coda.io/d/handbook_d8YyqXR1Myf/Issues-changelog_suHR-)****,** **[ðŸ‘‰ a more 'forced' focus on 'open comms'](https://coda.io/d/handbook_d8YyqXR1Myf/Meeting-Cadence_suoFD)**, a considered refocus of **[ðŸ‘‰ team meetings](https://coda.io/d/handbook_d8YyqXR1Myf/Meeting-Cadence_suoFD)****,** etc
