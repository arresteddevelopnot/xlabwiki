The **scope + objective** of this is to address:

> On my first week on this team, what do I need to know to be at the right place at the right time?

What this is 🎯
------------

-   an informal (but **structured +** **accurate**) **snapshot** of **our workflows**
-   the **team's meta-knowledge** in one place

What this is not ☠️
----------------

-   a **knowledge-base for everything** we've done
-   information on anything beyond **core team admin**

First steps
===========

-   Get access to the **xLab Slack** (#kp)
-   Get access to the **xLab Tandem** (#os)
-   Get access to **Jira & Confluence**
-   Get access to **Miro** (#yc)
-   Subscribe to the **shared** **Calendar** (#os)

TL 🔥

(in the spirit of documenting everything):

**Documentation** is a **universal 'best practice'** for **distributed, asynchronous teams,** according to those that have been '**doing distributed**' for **longer + on a bigger scale** - **GitLab, Basecamp, Automattic,** etc;  this is an **experiment** to see if we agree

The principle behind it is similar to the other things I've been pushing (which may not be a good thing 😬)

- **[👉 Tandem](Our-Toolkit)**
- [👉 JIRA sucks / better programme management](OKRs)
- [👉 a changelog](Changelog)
- **[👉 a more deliberate focus on transparency and openness](Meeting-Cadence)**
- a considered refocus of **[👉 team meetings](https://coda.io/d/handbook_d8YyqXR1Myf/Meeting-Cadence_suoFD)** 

etc, with the overarching idea being that anyone is able to define **who we are, what we do, and what we're doing right now (which is consistent with the first 2 points)**
