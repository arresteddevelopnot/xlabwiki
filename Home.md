##xLab Handbook
### Why do we need this? 
We've not been working in a distributed manner for long. More importantly, **we're not great at it**. (This isn't a knock - just a reflection of how incredibly self-aware we are.) Instead of building from scratch, we've looked and talked to firms that have been doing this for longer, on a bigger scale, and better than us - **GitLab, Basecamp, Automattic, Tandem, YC, Doist**, and more. 

We're well aware of the power (and need) for asynchronous workflows, communication tools, documentation, etc - those guys have been espousing that mantra for years.

One common piece of advice from these firms is the **importance of a handbook**; although they primarily contextualise it from the perspective of new-joiners (which isn't an issue for us) I think, given the uncertainty of knowledge-sharing amongst our team currently, some of us may find it useful.

Or not.
