TL
(in the spirit of documenting everything):

Weâ€™re not great at distributed working (weâ€™re better than many around us, but thatâ€™s not a representative sample). Thatâ€™s not a knock against us - weâ€™ve had no reason to be

Documentation is a universal â€˜best practiceâ€™ for distributed, asynchronous teams, according to those that have been â€˜doing distributedâ€™ for longer + on a bigger scale - GitLab, Basecamp, Automattic, etc;  this is an experiment to see if we agree

Similar rationale for the other stuff I was â€˜pushingâ€™ ðŸ˜¬
e.g. ðŸ‘‰ Tandem, ðŸ‘‰ JIRA sucks / better programme management, ðŸ‘‰ a changelog, ðŸ‘‰ a more 'forced' focus on 'open comms', a considered refocus of ðŸ‘‰ team meetings, etc
