DRI / Directly Responsible Individual
-------------------------------------

Apple coined the term "directly responsible individual" (DRI) to refer to the **one person with whom the buck stopped on any given project**. The idea is that every project is assigned an ***empowered*** DRI who is ultimately held accountable for the success (or failure) of that project.

Issues, proposed changes, etc should be raised directly with the DRI; **the DRI's decision is final** - **even for cray decisions** like killing **Tandem** and reverting to **Zoom** or burying **standup&chill**

The DRI must **effectively communicate** this with the **full team**

**Every initiative** will have a **DRI**

Sprint Sovereign
----------------

Each team member will be **sprint sovereign** at some point - this role rotates every 2 weeks. Their final day ends with a **retro session**. They are the **[DRIs üëâ](https://coda.io/d/handbook_d8YyqXR1Myf/How-we-enable-work_suTXa)** for:

-   **Organising and running** team-meetings (**standup, backlog, retro**)
-   where relevant, **updating the** **[changelog ‚ö°Ô∏è](Changelog)**+ ensuring updates are **communicated effectively [see** **[Making changes](https://coda.io/d/handbook_d8YyqXR1Myf/Making-changes_suGKS)****]**

Tandem & live projects
----------------------

To address [üëâ issue #1](https://coda.io/d/handbook_d8YyqXR1Myf/Issues-changelog_suHR-) we will **liberally add + delete channels** on Tandem to reflect **live projects** i.e. projects we're working on **right now**

Project Management
------------------

**DRI - sprint sovereign**

**What:** **Jira** to track the high-level status of **live projects, our project backlog, and incoming projects**

**When**: During **Pipeline** and **Backlog** sessions

**[Meeting Cadence](Meeting-Cadence)**

*Status: not providing enough insight on project and team workload*

--

Task Tracking
-------------

**DRI - sprint sovereign**

**What:** **Jira** to track **individual tasks** on a per-project basis

**When:** No dedicated session ¬†- the team is expected to do this as part of their day-to-day tasks

*Status: not providing enough insight to PMs; not providing enough support as a task-tracker to team*
